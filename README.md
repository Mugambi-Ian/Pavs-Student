# PAVS Student
Pavs student is the student endpoint to my Project Allocation and Verification System. Since the app was developed for my school, it allows logins only from email accounts with "@kabarak.ac.ke" domain. 

It provides students with the following options:  
  -_Selecting between team and solo projects._  
  -_Registering team's or solo projects._  
  -_Acquring a project commencement approval from the admin._  
  -_Provides in app group chat for team members._  
  -_Allows students to submit their projects via mobile phones._
